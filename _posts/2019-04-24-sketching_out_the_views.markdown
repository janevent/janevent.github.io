I began my Sinatra project taking heed of advice  about planning before coding.  This was to my benefit and having a clearly defined purpose for my first website before touching the keyboard meant I was able to code at ease and didn't have to make any major changes.  However, I stopped short of designing before hand, how my web pages would relate to each other, and how users would interact with the website.

1) First, I decided who my website  was for: creative individuals and the likes.  I needed a users (creatives)  table and model.
2) I decided that the users would be creating posts showcasing their art.  One user had many art pieces and an art piece had one user. 
3) Next, what I would have, should have done,  was sketch out the views.  What will every view page contain? How will the user navigate from one page to the next (create a smooth experience, rather than an irritating, jumbled one)?  Perhaps mapping these pages, and links out , before actually creating the pages would have resulted in a less chaotic work process for myself, and a more friendly user experience.
